Using the Lightning Network to enable trustless payment settlements in high-risk areas, Open Source Digital Public Good (DPG) offers a logistics framework that is resistant to censorship.

1. Executive Synopsis

EduReach is a novel Open Source Digital Public Good that is set to unlock new Open Educational Resources for communities and people not located within urban market places and are underserved. We are building a reusable e-Commerce software framework along with a Digital Logistics R&D Module, which will empower community-based organizations to manage, in a safe, transparent, and commercially viable way, the distribution of digitally charged educational materials. In order to promote educational equity for marginalized communities, we will employ targeted open technology that is founded on the censorship resistance and transparency of Bitcoin.

2. Issues at Hand

For many students, gaps in the geography and the physical supply shops, hurts access to quality educational materials and educational resources profoundly. Such problems translate to poor performance and, at the worst, loss of equitable opportunities in academia. We are promoting a targeted Open Source decentralized digital strategy that makes use of Bitcoin-related freedom technologies to close the gaps and offer the rest of the world a first-cut blueprint for censorship-resistant Public Goods delivery systems.

3. The Solution

For local non-profits, EduReach gives them the ability to adapt the core Open-Source educational marketplace framework. An Open-Source Digital Logistics R&D module that focuses on safe, efficient, and cryptographically verifiable logistics is part of the framework.  In a high-risk area, this system will be designed to allow Lightning Network payments for community logistics partners, guaranteeing uncensorable and quick transaction settlement.

4. How It Works (Digital Focus)

1. Platform Access:  Customers access the resources via the EduReach Open Source web application or the mobile app to browse.  

2. Order Placement:  Online orders are coordinated for educational resources, and these include books and stationery.  

3. Digital Logistics:  The R&D software module for Resource Fulfillment and Distribution Logistics Optimizer determines the most effective distribution routes and fulfills the assigned tasks of Community Partner Logistics.  

4. Data Transparency:  Both the allocation of educational materials and the financial outlays will be monitored.  In order to ensure trustless accountability and financial privacy for all users—a crucial feature in politically challenging environments—the R&D module will investigate using Bitcoin's immutability to anchor logs (Proof-of-Delivery) on a simplified ledger.


5. Target Market

We focus primarily on students and parents situated in rural and marginalized communities. Our secondary audience comprises the global Public Goods community, including other nonprofits seeking a tested, open-source framework for efficient last-mile delivery and distribution of resources.

6. Budget Breakdown – Total Requested: $27,000

This budget is aligned with Digital Public Goods Funding priorities and dedicated solely to the Digital Public Goods R&D and Digital Public Goods infrastructure development. 

Cost Category (Public Goods Focus)	Amount Justification ( For Open-Source & DPG Grants )

Open-Source Platform Development	$10,000	To create the foundational Open Source code for the e-commerce website and mobile ordering system. This is the core Digital Public Good asset, allowing global reuse.

Technical Operations & Support Staff	$5,000	Allocating funds for key developer/technical support staff to maintain the Open Source codebase and manage necessary server infrastructure for the first year.

Community Outreach & Pilot Testing	$4,500	For community engagement to ensure the platform meets local needs, and for pilot testing the Open Source software in remote areas for functionality and user adoption.

Investigation and creation of software frameworks for digital inventory management and route optimization.  Importantly, this entails testing the Lightning Network's integration for logistics payments, guaranteeing community partners instantaneous, censorship-resistant settlement.  In keeping with HRF's goal of uncensorable money, this funding will also design the architecture for Bitcoin-based auditable transparency for the DPG's supply chain logs.

Legal & Regulatory Compliance Setup	$4,000	To cover legal fees for establishing the organization as a legitimate entity eligible for grants and ensuring compliance with basic Web3 governance standards.
